## File structure
- `process_dataset.py` -> This file processes the raw dataset in a way that can be directly used by our neural network. Dataset properties and rows, no. of digits, etc. can be tweaked in this file. But some other constants in other files may need to also be changed if these are changed.
- `load_dataset.py` -> This file handles the processing of our processed dataset.
- `train_neural_network.py` ->  This file contains the code for training the neural network model. A processed dataset needs to be there in order this to run. Epochs, no. of layers, etc. can be tweaked in this file.
- `raw_dataset.zip` -> This is the raw dataset. It needs to be extracted before running this project.
- `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` -> Files generated by `pipenv` - a virtual environment manager for Python.
- `encoder_decoder.py` -> This file contains the code for processing the `encoder` and `decoder` parts from a single model.
- `trained_models/` -> This directory contains some of the trained models while working on this project.
- `final_model/` -> This directory contains the code for the final code and unequal encoder and decoder parts.
- `README.md` -> Documentation for the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.5
- pipenv
